# README for the Data Directory

This directory contains the datasets used for training and evaluating the regression machine learning model.

## Dataset Structure

- **train.csv**: This file contains the training dataset used for training the regression model. It includes features and the target variable that the model will learn to predict.
  
- **test.csv**: This file contains the test dataset used for evaluating the regression model. It is structured similarly to the training dataset and includes features and the target variable for performance assessment.

## Data Description

- Each dataset is in CSV format and can be easily loaded using pandas.
- Ensure that the datasets are preprocessed before feeding them into the model training pipeline.
- Check for missing values and outliers in the datasets as part of the data preprocessing steps.

## Usage

To load the datasets, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
import pandas as pd

train_data = pd.read_csv('data/train.csv')
test_data = pd.read_csv('data/test.csv')
```

Make sure to explore the datasets and understand their structure before proceeding with model training.
